# Contributing

Contributors should fork this repo.  Changes should be made in feature branches in their own repo.  A feature is then submitted to this repo via creating a GitHub Pull Request (PR).  The Pull Request can then be merged by the contributor or another developer with commit access.

### Work with a Feature Branch

1. `git checkout -b new-feature`
